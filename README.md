Description: 

This is a Drink Recipe Website that uses HTML 5, CSS, PHP, and Javascript on the frontend, and a SQL database to store the recipes.

The website itself has two different sections but both follow the same layout with different dropdown menus that allows a user to select various ingredients.

Once ingredients have been selected a list of recipes will be displayed and stepping deeper into the individual drinks will provide step by step instructions on how to make it.
